    Strengths
      - Interactive navbar with dropdown menus works well
      - Embedded spotify player
      - Manages to display all the artist information completely
      
    Weaknesses
      - Layout... bit of a mess. Relies on flexboxes too much and doesnt provide a clean layout.
      - Too much information in a small space
    
    Opportunities
